    I’m Luke.  I like riding my bicycle and getting lost in the woods.  I also enjoy tinkering with circuits and shifting bits around until they do what I want!  I was born in New York City and raised in New Jersey, and now I’m pursuing my BS in Computer Science and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University in the wonderfully frigid city of Boston.  I am presently a lead developer on VolunteerScience.com at Northeastern’s own Lazer Science Lab.  In the past, I’ve been a freelance web developer and a research intern at Kirusa.  Have a look at my resume and my projects.  If you like what you see, you are more than welcome to offer me a job!  Also, please check back here Saturday evening; there will be more content!
